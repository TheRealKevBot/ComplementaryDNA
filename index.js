//  In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". 
//  You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. 
//  DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

// DNAStrand ("ATTGC") returns "TAACG"
// DNAStrand ("GTAT")  returns "CATA"
